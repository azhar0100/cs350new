==========

I am submitting this early hoping to get some feedback.

I intend to submit again after I have completed the requirements for the bonus problem.

However, I would like it if one of you would:
	1) Run the program on a couple of test images,
	2) Verify that the output images are correct, IF NOT, TELL ME
	3) Verify that the statistics are correct, IF NOT, PLEASE:
		a) send me the image you are using to test, and
		b) the statistics you were expecting

(I lost some points on the global statistics portion, but I am
not sure what results I should be getting.)

Thanks!

P.S., I am including a couple of extra files. I created these simple pthreads examples
to help me learn the basics of using the library. You may find them useful in this or
a future class.
